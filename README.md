  Project Overview

This project delves into various image processing techniques, focusing on practical implementations and visual analysis. Key areas explored include:

Noise Removal: Identifying and mitigating common image noise types.
Image Sharpening: Enhancing details using spatial and frequency domain methods (Unsharp Masking).
Intensity Transformations: Applying Log and Inverse Log transformations for dynamic range adjustments.
Histogram Processing: Understanding and utilizing Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement.

Required Libraries

Before running the project, please install the following Python libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

Libraries Used

OpenCV (`cv2`): Essential for core image processing operations such as reading, displaying, and manipulating images, as well as applying filters and transformations.
NumPy (`numpy`): Fundamental for high-performance numerical computations, especially for array and matrix manipulations crucial for image data.
Matplotlib (`matplotlib.pyplot`): Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, primarily for displaying images and generating histograms.
